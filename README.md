# C64 Lumafix
Based on Lumafix64 by e5frog over at the lemon64.com forums, this is a somewhat
simplified version that should be easier to solder together for beginners with
access to a reasonable set of soldering tools. Gone are the surface mount options
as well as most of the issues with overlapping components on the same board.
